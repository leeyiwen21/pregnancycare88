These fish have high levels of mercury, which can harm your baby. If you eat tuna, make sure it is light tuna. Do not eat more than 6 ounces of albacore tuna and tuna steaks per week. It is safe to have 12 ounces of canned light tuna per week.

<h3>How long can I keep working?</h3>
<p>How late you work in pregnancy varies for each person. Your job and work environment play a big role. For instance, radiation, lead and other materials, such as copper and mercury, can be harmful to your baby. If your job is active, you may not be able to work as late. Desk jobs are not thought to cause harm to your baby. However, you should not rest a computer on your stomach or uterus. Your overall health also plays a part in how late you work. If you are at risk of certain issues or preterm labor, you may be on bed rest.</p>
